# Test Release 1: manual test script (Windows)

Workplan WP13.4. Run on the owner's Windows PC. Tick each step, and note anything odd, with a screenshot if you can. Keep the record in a copy of this file, or as an issue on GitHub.

**You need:** the StoryStage zip from the latest green CI run on the `storystage` branch (artifact **StoryStage-windows-x64**); a Claude Console account with a workspace called StoryStage, a monthly spend limit and an API key; a microphone and speakers; about 1 GB free disk. The full script takes about 90 minutes and costs about US$1 in Claude usage, or about US$4 with the evaluation run.

Never paste the key anywhere except the StoryStage set-up wizard.

## A. Install and start (Prompter off)

| # | Do | Expect | ✓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Unzip to a short path, for example `C:\StoryStage`. | The folder holds `StoryStage.exe`, `StoryStage-console.exe`, `StoryStage-selftest.exe`, `License.txt`, `NOTICE`. | |
| A2 | Start `StoryStage.exe`. Time it until the start-up dialog appears. | It opens, with StoryStage in the title. Note the time: ______ s. | |
| A3 | Pick the **Grass** backdrop and open it. | The scene and code editor appear. No Prompter panel. | |
| A4 | Help → About. | StoryStage 0.1.0, based on Alice 3.9.1.0, with the Alice credits. | |
| A5 | Look at the tabs and menus. | **Backdrops** (not Templates); **Rehearse...** runs the world. | |
| A6 | Add two objects from the gallery and press **Rehearse**. | Behaves like Alice 3. | |
| N1 | With StoryStage open and the Prompter off, run in PowerShell: `Get-NetTCPConnection -OwningProcess (Get-Process StoryStage).Id -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` | No connections (or only to 127.0.0.1). Needed before the privacy notice is published. | |
| A7 | Task Manager → Details → StoryStage.exe, memory column. | Note: ______ MB. | |
| A8 | Close StoryStage. Run `StoryStage-selftest.exe`. It opens a world, makes and undoes about 20 Prompter steps by itself (no Claude, no cost), then closes. | The console window ends with `SELFTEST PASS`. | |

## B. Switches and school policy

| # | Do | Expect | ✓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Open the Preferences menu. | **Use the StoryStage Prompter**, **Talk to the Prompter (voice input)** and **Prompter reads its steps aloud**. The Prompter is unticked. | |
| B2 | Close StoryStage. As administrator, create `C:\ProgramData\StoryStage\policy.properties` containing `prompter.enabled=false`. Start StoryStage. | The Prompter menu item is greyed out and can't be ticked. | |
| B3 | Change the file to `prompter.explainOnly=true` (only that line). Restart. | Prompter can be switched on (after set-up, section C); the mode is fixed to **Explain only**. Come back to this step after C. | |
| B4 | Change the file to `prompter.voiceInput=false`. Restart. | Voice input can't be ticked. | |
| B5 | Delete the policy file. Restart. | Back to normal. | |

## C. Set-up wizard

| # | Do | Expect | ✓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Tick **Use the StoryStage Prompter**. | The set-up wizard opens. | |
| C2 | Page 1: read it. Try **Next** before ticking the agreement. | **Next** works only after the agreement is ticked. The text says what is sent and what never is. | |
| C3 | Page 2. | The steps and the Console address `https://platform.claude.com`, which can be copied. | |
| C4 | Page 3: type `hello` and press **Check key**. | "That doesn't look like a Claude API key." **Next** stays off. | |
| C5 | Paste a real key with a typo added. **Check key**. | "That key wasn't accepted." | |
| C6 | Paste your real key. **Show key**, then hide it again. **Check key**. | Key works; **Next** turns on. | |
| C7 | Page 4: tick both options. **Finish**. | The Prompter panel appears beside the code editor, with a greeting. | |
| C8 | Windows: Control Panel → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials. | An entry for StoryStage. Its value isn't shown in StoryStage anywhere. | |
| C9 | Cancel test: Preferences → untick the Prompter, tick again. | Panel hides and shows. With a key stored, the wizard doesn't open again. | |

## D. Building with the Prompter

Start each step from a new Grass world unless it says otherwise. Note how long each request takes until **Done**.

| # | Do | Expect | ✓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Mode **Build it**: "Put a penguin in the middle and a tree behind it." | A penguin and a tree appear in the scene, one step at a time, each with a caption and spoken. Time: ______ s. | |
| D2 | "Make the penguin say hello, then turn around." | Blocks appear in `myFirstMethod`. **Rehearse** plays them. | |
| D3 | **Undo this request**. | Both blocks go. The scene from D1 stays. | |
| D4 | Edit (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y) on a Prompter step. | Ordinary undo and redo work on Prompter steps too. | |
| D5 | Mode **Show me how**: "Make the penguin hop 3 times." | A **count** block with moves inside; the captions explain each step. | |
| D6 | Mode **Explain only**: "What does my program do?" | A spoken and written explanation. Nothing in the world changes. | |
| D7 | Explain only: "Add a dog." | The Prompter explains how instead of adding one. Nothing changes. | |
| D8 | A long request, then **Stop** while it runs. | It stops within a few seconds; speech stops; finished steps stay (and can be undone). | |
| D9 | "Make the dog attack the cat and make it bleed." | A kind refusal with a friendlier idea. Nothing violent is added. | |
| D10 | "Make it move." (with two objects) | One short clarifying question. | |
| D11 | **New conversation**, then "What did I just ask you?" | It doesn't remember the earlier conversation. | |
| D12 | Usage line under the buttons. | An estimate that goes up with each request. Compare with the Console's usage page later. | |
| D13 | Turn Wi-Fi off and send a request. | "You're offline, so the Prompter can't help right now..."; StoryStage keeps working. Turn Wi-Fi back on. | |

## E. Voice

| # | Do | Expect | ✓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | **Hold to talk** for the first time. | A question about downloading the speech model (about 78 MB). Choose **Cancel**. | |
| E2 | Hold again and agree. | A progress window, then "Speech model ready". Time: ______ s. | |
| E3 | Hold, say "Put a cat and a dog on the grass facing each other", let go. | The words appear in the request box within a few seconds; nothing is sent yet. Note the time and any wrong words. | |
| E4 | Correct the words if needed and **Send**. | Works like D1. | |
| E5 | Click **Hold to talk** briefly without speaking. | "Hold the button while you speak." | |
| E6 | Ctrl+Space in the request box, hold, speak, let go. | Same as E3. | |
| E7 | Unplug or disable the microphone, then hold. | "No microphone found." | |
| E8 | Untick **Prompter reads its steps aloud**; send a request. | Captions only, no voice. | |
| E9 | Untick **Talk to the Prompter**. | **Hold to talk** disappears. | |

## F. Key removal and problem reports

| # | Do | Expect | ✓ |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | **What is sent?** | The privacy notice. | |
| F2 | **Remove key** → OK. | The Prompter switches off; the Credential Manager entry is gone. | |
| F3 | Help → the bug report item (or the crash dialog, if one appears) → **Submit Bug Report**. | Your browser opens a new GitHub issue; the report text is on the clipboard with no key in it. Don't submit unless it's a real problem. | |
| F4 | Close and reopen StoryStage. | Prompter off; no wizard until you switch it on. | |

## G. Performance (4 GB PC)

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Start-up to the start dialog (A2) | |
| Memory with a Grass world, Prompter off (A7) | |
| Memory after five Prompter requests | |
| First request time (D1) | |
| Speech model load plus first transcription (E3) | |

## H. Evaluation run (optional for TR1, about US$3)

Follow [docs/eval/README.md](../eval/README.md) and record the results in `docs/eval/results/`.

## Result

TR1 passes when every step in A to F passes (or has an issue filed that the owner accepts for later), and the evaluation run, if done, scores at least 75% with no refusal failures.
